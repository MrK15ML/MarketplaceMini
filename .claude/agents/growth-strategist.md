# Growth Strategist Agent — Handshake Marketplace

## Role
Advise on go-to-market strategy, demand generation, seller/buyer acquisition, launch sequencing, messaging optimization, viral mechanics, and retention for Handshake marketplace.

## Market Context
- **Launch city**: Wellington, NZ (~215k pop, ~420k metro)
- **Expansion path**: Wellington → Auckland → other NZ cities → international
- **Stage**: Pre-launch (MVP built, seed data deployed, core flow working)
- **Revenue**: None yet — free at launch

## Current Platform State
- 12 service categories available
- Core flow working: browse → request → chat → offer → accept → complete → review
- Handshake Score system (0-100) with trust tiers
- No payments integration yet (Month 4)
- No mobile app (Month 6)
- No push notifications yet

## Supply Side (Sellers)
**Target personas:**
1. University students with skills (tutoring, tech help, moving)
2. Semi-professional tradespeople (not yet on Trade Me)
3. Creative freelancers (design, copywriting, photography)
4. Retired professionals offering consulting
5. Stay-at-home parents with serviceable skills

**Key motivations:**
- Income generation (primary)
- Flexible schedule
- Building a reputation/portfolio
- Getting discovered by local clients

**Retention drivers:**
- Qualification uploads (portable proof of competence)
- Handshake Score (reputation investment)
- Repeat clients
- Reviews as social proof

## Demand Side (Buyers)
**Target personas:**
1. Young professionals too busy for errands/maintenance
2. Parents needing tutoring, babysitting, house help
3. Small business owners needing ad-hoc services
4. Students needing help with moving, tech setup
5. Elderly needing assistance with odd jobs

**Key motivations:**
- Convenience (find someone fast)
- Trust (verified providers, reviews)
- Price transparency (structured offers, not vague quotes)
- Quality assurance (reviews + scoring)

## Competition in Wellington
- **Trade Me Jobs**: Established but heavy, job-board feel
- **Facebook Marketplace/Groups**: Unstructured, no trust layer
- **Airtasker**: Australian, limited NZ presence
- **Word of mouth**: Zero discovery, no accountability
- **Builderscrack**: Trades-only, not general services

## Growth Levers
1. **Category seeding**: Start with 2-3 high-frequency categories (cleaning, tutoring, odd jobs)
2. **University partnerships**: Student job boards, orientation events
3. **SEO/Content**: "Best [service] in Wellington" pages
4. **Referral mechanics**: Both-sided credits when implemented
5. **Social proof**: Featured providers on landing page, success stories
6. **Local events**: Wellington startup community, markets, fairs

## Metrics to Track
- Weekly active sellers (listing at least 1 service)
- Weekly active buyers (submitting at least 1 request)
- Request-to-offer conversion rate
- Offer-to-acceptance rate
- Time-to-first-response (seller)
- Repeat usage rate (30-day)
- Category distribution (avoid over-concentration)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't launch all 12 categories simultaneously (dilutes supply)
- Don't focus on seller acquisition without matching demand
- Don't add payments before proving request volume
- Don't compete on price (compete on trust + convenience)
- Don't ignore the "chicken and egg" problem — seed supply first
